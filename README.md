Description
========================

"Joe LaMachette is an unpublished platform game for MS-DOS made between 1994 and 1997. 
It was programmed entirely in x86 assembly language (and compiled using Borland Turbo Assembler)
on a 80486 80Mhz processor. The game supports a VGA resolution of 320x200 with 256 colors.
Most images were scanned from various sources and then edited in an image editing software that I had previously
written in Turbo Pascal. When drawing the main character, I tried to replicate the movements of Aladdin in a video
game developed by Virgin Interactive Entertainment. Some of the sound effects were recorded by me, whereas others 
were produced by editing sound files taken from different sources. Although I wrote the sound engine 
(this part is actually a .mod player and represents half the source code of the game), 
the background music was not composed by me; it comes from a few freeware music files I had back then." (St√©phane Pelletier, https://sites.google.com/site/joelamachette/home/joelamachettevideogame )

How to play
===========

If you do not have a real or virtual machine capable of running native DOS programs, I recommend using DOSBox, a nice x86 DOS emulator.
In DOSBox, you should increase the CPU cycles to around 20000 (by pressing ctrl-F12 several times), 
otherwise the game will be really slow. You can type the following cheat codes during the game if necessary:
